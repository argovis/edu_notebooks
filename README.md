# Argovis Educational Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks meant to support educational activities in a number of settings; not all of them are meant to be used outside of the classes they support. If you're looking 
for more self-directed notebooks you can follow on your own to learn how to use Argovis, see our [demo notebooks](https://github.com/argovis/demo_notebooks).
